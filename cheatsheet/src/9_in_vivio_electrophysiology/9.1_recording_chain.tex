\subsection*{Recording Chain}

\textbf{Ground lead:}
Return path for headstage power.

\textbf{Recording electrode:}
Placed near cells of interest to measure extracellular potentials.  
Small area: high impedance, high spatial resolution.  
Large area: low impedance, low spatial resolution.

\textbf{Reference electrode:}
Placed in low cell-density region to record far-field noise.  
Used for common-mode noise subtraction.
